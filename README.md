## Documentation
The following functions are implemented in this app, you can find them in helpers.js file in the main directory

* `getUserIDByEmail(email, userDatabase)`: a function that takes in an email and database and returns a user id, if matched is found in database
* `getURLSByUserID(userID, urlDatabase)`: a function that takes in a userID and a database and returns an object - in this case an object of urls that belong to the user with the specified user ID
* `renderError(status, title, msg)`: function that takes in an html status code, an error title and msg, and returns a string of html that will print to the user's screen should they encounter that error. 
* if you wish to test the above functions please make sure to install mocha chai using the following command:`npm install mocha chai --save-dev` 
  - change your test scripts in the package.json to include `"./node_modules/mocha/bin/mocha"`
  - now you are ready to test the functions. In your terminal from the tinyapp directory run run `npm test`

## Troubleshooting

- If you change anything in the files please make sure to restart the server to see the changes on the client / browser

### Changing PORTs

In the express_server.js file change  `const PORT = 8080;` to your desired PORT

### Vagrant

`Error: listen EADDRINUSE :::8080`
In the off chance that you encounter this error while running the app from vagrant consider restarting vagrant and your computer to clear listener cache.
